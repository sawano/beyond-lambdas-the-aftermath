##Abstract
As Java developers we are used to having rich ecosystems of libraries and tools that make our lives easier. As of the release of Java 8, we finally got our hands on 
building blocks like lambdas, optionals, and streams. All sorts of tools that help us write more concise code. But now, when the honeymoon is over, are there any 
downsides to Java 8 or is it a silver bullet? Are there any new anti-patterns emerging? Or subtle bugs caused by the new style of programming? Have there been any 
lessons learned? Are there any best practices? If you are interested in learning about the challenges encountered when moving over to a functional style of Java programming, 
what code constructs to avoid, and best practices to use, well then this session is for you.
